Write a blog on difference between HTTP 1.1 Vs HTTP 2

HTTP 1.1:
        1. It works on textual format
        2.It uses request resource lining for getting multiple pages.
        3.it compresses data by itself.
        4.HTTP 1.1 allows only one request and response to be sent at a time.
        5.All requests are treated equally.
        6.Wrrors can disrupt the entire connection.
        7.Server push is not supported.

HTTP 2:
         1.it works on binary protocol.
         2.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
         3.It uses HIACK for data compression.
         4.HTTP 2 allows multiple request and response to be sent over a single connection.
         5.It allows client to specify priority of request.
         6.Errors are disrupted to individual streams, allowing other streams to continue unaffected.
         7.It allows server push resource to clients before the client requests them,reducing the need for additional request.
